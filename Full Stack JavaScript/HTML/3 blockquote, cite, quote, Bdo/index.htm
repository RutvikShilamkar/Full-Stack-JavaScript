        Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low altitude
        service. The connection topology is limited to a single point-to-point path
        for each carrier, used with standard carriers, but many carriers can be used
        without significant interference with each other, outside early spring.
        This is because of the 3D ether space available to the carriers, in contrast
        to the 1D ether used by IEEE802.3. The carriers have an intrinsic collision
        avoidance system, which increases availability.
